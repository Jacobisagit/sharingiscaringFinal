<h2> OUR AIM</h2>
<h3>We are trying to completely change the way we help those in need by creating and alternative to the conventional method of donating.This is done through using hemp seeds rather than donating money which leads to corruption.A single penny can purchase 50 seeds which can ultimately turn into a massive scale farming production and economy. </h3>

  <h2> OUR PASSION</h2>
<h3>Our passion is Hemp.We believe hemp seeds is the answer to poverty,this plant can be grown anywhere in the world with virtually no water at all.This plant has thousands of uses from having 30 grams of protein per 100grams which will stop malnurishment, to being able to be used as an alternative to concrete for construction, to it being able to be used for animal bedding and feed and many many more.We are trying to allow these poverty striken villages and towns to create their own economy from hemp, in term exporting the products they produce and with the seeds they produce from the plant we will buy them and contiue the cycle by giving them to another village elsewere creating a profitable economy for them.  </h3>
