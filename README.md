# sharingiscaring

### The Cause? 

My chosen cause is to improve the way we donate and give to charities. The idea is to educate people on how their money is being used in the charity industry and how opting for this new innovative refreshing concept of donating would completely change the way charities work.

### My Target Auidence?

The concept is aimed at all ages as a single pound can purchase two hundred grams of seeds, so people can donate pennies and still make a huge contribution that will only grow and become an investment for the chosen village allowing them to develop and grow their own economy.

### Reaction?

Ideally I would like my audience to be shocked at the number of cases of corruption in charities and the huge amount the industry is worth, while a vast amount of the donations actually just go to paying overheads and large pay checks. As well as this, simultaneously I am trying to educate my audience on the benefits of hemp seeds as an alternative to your conventional donation.

### Call to action? 

I would like to persuade my audience into avoiding convential charities, to promote and educate the benefits of hemp and to really give the user a greater understanding of the topic and ideally give a miniscule amount of money to purchase some seeds which will help prosper and benefit someones life who is in need.

### Symbols?
To try to get my point across in the most effective way possible I will aim to use graphs, statistics and imagery to convey the concept of my idea and to help these vital facts come across clearly. This will allow the user to absorb and take in all the relevent key information which will only educate the audience, to really have a grasp on the movement and concept.

### Debate?
To allow people to voice their own opinions or maybe to clarify something they dont fully understand, I could have a chat section on the site which allows people to hear from others on what their outlook on the concept is. This could encourage people to become a donater if other people are saying it is successful. This could also add constructive criticism that could further benefit the idea and movement.

### Content?
I have spent hours reading through countless stories of charity corruption, how much money the industry is really worth and how donations are being used for other agendas. It is easy to see a fresh change is needed. Also, I have been reading a lot about the benefits of hemp and how it is easily grown in any conditions around the world within a 12 week cycle. Aswell as finding so much information on hemp that your average person is not aware of that which would completely alter someones outlook and impression of hemp, I have also looked at charity websites to try to gain an understanding of how their system runs and take any pros and cons I could find and adapt it to my work. For example, I felt having donation boxes popping up everywhere on the page felt like you were being forced and pressured into donating rather than being persuaded and feeling passionate on why you are giving your money.“Personally, I don’t think that charities in Africa really work,” says Akon. “I think it just holds the people down longer than it should. I think the only way to build Africa is to build for-profit businesses that create opportunities and jobs for the people locally. That’s why with Akon Lighting Africa we decided to take a for-profit approach. Ultimately, it’s providing empowerment to local people so they can start developing their own economies.”(qoute from akon)

### Story?
The story my page tells is one of an outdated broken donations system we currently live in and how a new cost effective efficent concept could completely change the way we donate, with the help of educating my audience throughout their journey on the site they should leave with a good knowledge and understanding of the benefits of hemp and the downfalls of how unethical the current large charity corporations operate making millions on donations, but not putting the majority to the cause.

### Wireframe idea's?
For my frames I have tried to go with a really simple basic layout. The idea is to have images of each town that you can donate to, and when you hover over the image it will slide up and tell you how many plants have been grown and information on the village and what the people can use it for. Aswell as a donate button which will allow you to purchase seeds from 1p onwards. Inbetween the villages I thought I could have facts and information fading in and out which will help the user absorb the vital facts and information on the topic.
